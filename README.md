# Discord Quiz Pounce Bot

Bot using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to
implement a write-only channel (at the moment). 

## Setup

Install required packages in a virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make a `.env` file in this format:
```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=<bot token id>
```
This assumes you know how to create a bot, etc. IIIT TVQRC members can use the
file :TM:

Run:
```
python quizpounce.py
```
